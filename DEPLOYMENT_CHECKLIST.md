- [ ] Workflow committed and pushed
- [ ] First run successful (check Actions tab)

### Option 3: UptimeRobot
- [ ] Account created
- [ ] Monitor added for health endpoint
- [ ] Interval: 5 minutes (free tier)
- [ ] Monitor active

---

## Security Checklist

- [ ] JWT_SECRET is strong (32+ characters)
- [ ] No secrets in git repository
- [ ] `.env` files in `.gitignore`

## Common Issues & Quick Fixes

| Issue | Quick Fix |
|-------|-----------|
| Build fails | Check logs, verify dependencies in `package.json` |
| CORS error | Update `CLIENT_URL` in backend environment |
| 502 Bad Gateway | Check backend logs, verify start command |
| Database connection error | Verify DATABASE_URL, check SSL configuration |
| Frontend shows blank page | Check browser console, verify `VITE_API_URL` |
| Cold start too slow | Set up keep-alive service |
