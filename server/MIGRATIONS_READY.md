## ✨ What's Included (Assignment-Based Model)

All migrations are **fresh and correct** for the assignment-based model:

### Users Table
- ✅ Basic auth fields (email, password)
- ✅ Profile fields (name, phone, address, location)
- ✅ Provider fields (bio, skills, certifications)
- ✅ Provider metrics (rating, jobs completed, jobs declined, response time)
- ✅ Role management (is_admin, is_service_provider, provider_status)

### Service Categories & Tiers
- ✅ Service categories (Plumbing, Electrical, HVAC, Cleaning, Landscaping)
- ✅ Service tiers (Basic, Expert, Premium with hourly rates)

### Provider Categories (NEW!)
- ✅ Provider qualifications by category
- ✅ **Tier qualifications** (JSON array: basic/expert/premium)
- ✅ Admin verification system

### Service Requests (Assignment-Based!)
- ✅ **assigned_provider_id** (not selected_provider_id)
- ✅ Assignment tracking (assigned_at, provider_accepted_at, provider_declined_at)
- ✅ Status: pending → assigned → in_progress → completed
- ✅ **No proposal fields!**

### Reviews & Notifications
- ✅ Complete review system with criteria ratings
- ✅ Notification system for all events

## 🚀 Run Migrations Now

```bash
# 1. Drop old database
psql -U postgres
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS servicehub_db;
CREATE DATABASE servicehub_db;
\q

# 2. Run migrations (should succeed!)
cd server
npm run migrate

# 3. Seed sample data
npm run seed

# 4. Start server
npm run dev
```

## Expected Output

**No errors!** ✨

## 🎉 What Changed

### Fixed Issues:
1. ❌ **Removed** all old `20240726_*.ts` files with wrong ordering
2. ✅ **Created** new migrations with sequential timestamps (`000001`, `000002`, etc.)
3. ❌ **Removed** obsolete proposal system files
4. ✅ **Included** all assignment-model changes in base migrations

### No Longer Needed:
- ❌ `20250930_update_to_assignment_model.ts` - deleted (changes already in base migrations)
- ❌ `20240726_create_proposals.ts` - deleted (no proposals in assignment model)
- ❌ `20240726_add_proposal_foreign_key.ts` - deleted (was causing errors)

## 🔍 Verify Tables Were Created

```bash
psql -U postgres -d servicehub_db
\dt
```

Should show:
```
 public | users
 public | service_categories
 public | service_tiers
 public | provider_categories
 public | service_requests
 public | reviews
 public | notifications
```

Check service_requests structure:
```sql
\d service_requests
```

Should show `assigned_provider_id` (NOT `selected_provider_id`) ✅

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. ✅ Run migrations (should work now!)
2. ✅ Seed database
3. ✅ Test with Postman or curl
4. ✅ Connect frontend client
5. ✅ Test complete workflow:
   - Customer creates request
   - Provider receives notification
   - Provider accepts assignment
   - Provider completes job
   - Customer leaves review
