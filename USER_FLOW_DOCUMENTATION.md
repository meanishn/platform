## üéØ System Overview

### Core Concept
This platform connects **customers** who need services with **service providers** using an **automatic matching system**. There are NO manual proposals‚Äîthe system automatically finds and notifies qualified providers.

### User Types
- **Customer**: Creates service requests and selects from interested providers
- **Provider**: Receives job notifications, accepts assignments, performs work
- **Admin**: Oversees platform operations and user management

### Key Architecture Components
- **Automatic Matching Engine**: Matches requests to qualified providers based on:
  - Category expertise
  - Location proximity (within 50 miles)
  - Provider availability
  - Match score algorithm
- **Request Eligible Providers Table**: Tracks which providers were matched to which requests
- **Real-time WebSocket**: Live updates for status changes, new acceptances, etc.

- Customer sees "5 providers interested"
- Customer can review all 5 profiles
- Customer selects 1 provider
- That provider gets assignment
- Other 4 get "Not selected" notification

**Workaround:**

---

### 7. **Expired Requests**

## üîß Technical Implementation Notes

### Real-Time Updates (WebSocket Events)

```typescript
// Customer listens for:
- REQUEST_STATUS_CHANGED   // Status transitions
- PROVIDER_ACCEPTED        // New provider interested
- PROVIDER_CONFIRMED       // Assignment confirmed
- WORK_STARTED            // Provider started work
- WORK_COMPLETED          // Provider completed work

// Provider listens for:
- NEW_ASSIGNMENT          // New job available
- ASSIGNMENT_CONFIRMED    // Customer selected you
- ASSIGNMENT_REJECTED     // Customer chose someone else
- JOB_CANCELLED          // Customer cancelled
- JOB_REOPENED           // Job available again
```

### Database Tables Involved

1. **`service_requests`**
   - Main request data
   - Status tracking
   - Assignment info

2. **`request_eligible_providers`**
   - Tracks which providers matched
   - Provider-specific status
   - Match scores & distance

3. **`request_acceptances`**
   - Legacy table for acceptances
   - Being phased out in favor of `request_eligible_providers`

4. **`users`**
   - Customer & provider profiles
   - Ratings & stats
   - Contact info (with progressive disclosure)

5. **`notifications`**
   - All user notifications
   - Read/unread status
   - Action URLs

---

## ‚úÖ Key Takeaways

### For Customers:
